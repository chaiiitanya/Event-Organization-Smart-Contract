Blockchain Projet: Event Organisation using Smart contract

The way this smart contract works is the Event Planner and the user/ticket buyer both can work.
The user with an account can create the events by entering details like Event name, time, ticket
price and amount.
The User can buy the tickets by entering the event id and the amount of tickets the user want to
buy, the user must have enough eth or virtual 100 wei to buy the tickets.
These tickets can be transferred from one account to other using their id and amount they want
to tranfer.
All of the processes are performed on Remix IDE working on the Google Chrome Browser using
Internet.
The Smart contract is first developed on Remix IDE, then we have to compile it and deploy it.
In deployed the contracts, the above functions can be easily performed by both parties.

TechStack used: Chrome Browser, Remix IDE for Smart contract, Metamask for test ether wallet, Ganache for 100 Ether Account
